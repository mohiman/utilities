# utilities
This is a simple utility for any finance freak, it requires you to set up, emails whenever a transaction occurs on your credit card or bank.

This utility will scan your email (you'll need to provide credentials, obviously)

And can send you a text message/email at the end of the day, with the total spent. it's  a standalone application and you need to run it locally.

I tested with gmail, and windows/mac os's it seems to work okay.

here's a Sample config which it will need to run. There's a list of jar files it need too, I will updated the readme in coming days, otherwise it's setup as a maven project, you should be able to get the dependencies when you download this project.
